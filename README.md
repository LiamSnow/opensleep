# Ten Sleep üõåüí§üîü

Control the Eight Sleep Pod 3 locally and automatically!

Ten Sleep communicates with the bed's firmware (`frakenfirmware`) by pretending
to be the DAC. This means that, once setup, you __CANNOT__ use the Eight Sleep
mobile app to control the bed.

## Features üò¥
 1. Automatically set bed temperature every night
 2. Create a custom temperature profile
 3. Set a heat and/or vibration wakeup alarm
 4. Control settings and monitor remotely via API

## Setup ü•±
To use Ten Sleep you must disassemble the Eight Sleep Pod 3, modify the SD card's `rootfs.tar.gz`
to add your SSH key + root password, and reset the Pod. Then power the Pod while holding the small
button on the back, which performs a factory reset from `rootfs.tar.gz`. Now you can disable
Eight Sleep's update service and [Add Ten Sleep](#adding-ten-sleep-).
 - __Note__: the default SSH port for Pod 3 is `8822`.
 - __Disable Updates__: `systemctl disable --now swupdate-progress swupdate defibrillator eight-kernel telegraf vector`

Eventually I will add thorough tutorial for this, but for now I would recommend
[Bo Lopker's Tutorial](https://blopker.com/writing/04-zerosleep-1/#disassembly-overview)
and the [ninesleep instructions](https://github.com/bobobo1618/ninesleep?tab=readme-ov-file#instructions).

### Adding Ten Sleep üîü

Build with:

```bash
cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
```

 1. Modify `settings.json` to suit your needs
 2. `scp` the binary, `tensleep.service`, and `settings.json` to the Pod
 3. `ssh` in, sign in as root
 4. Move the binary and json to `/opt/tensleep`
 5. Move the service file to `/etc/systemd/system`
 6. Stop the DAC `systemctl disable --now dac`
 7. Enable the Ten Sleep `systemctl enable --now tensleep`

## API üîå

The entire API is JSON based.

### Errors
Some endpoints can throw an error (labeled Errorable) which has the standard type:
```json
{"error": ErrorString, "details": DetailsString}
```
(details is optional).

### Health
`GET /health` ‚Üí
```json
{"status": "OK" | "UNAVAILABLE"}
```
Returns whether it can communicate to frakenfirmware

### State
`GET /state` (Errorable) ‚Üí
```json
{
    "target_heat_level_left": i32,
    "target_heat_level_right": i32,
    "heat_level_left": i32,
    "heat_level_right": i32,
    "heat_time_left": u32,
    "heat_time_right": u32,
    "sensor_label": String,
    "water_level": bool,
    "priming": bool,
    "settings": String,
}
```
Returns state/variables directly from frakenfirmware.
`sensor_label` looks something like `20600-0001-F00-0001089C`,
and `settings` looks something like `BF61760162676C190190626772190190626C621864FF`


### Prime
`GET|POST /prime` (Errorable) ‚Üí
```json
{"response": ResponseString}
```
Tells frakenfirmware to prime the bed. This process can take awhile.
You can check when its done with `GET /state`.priming.

### Settings
__Settings Format__:
```json
{
    "temp_profile": [i32; 3],
    "time_zone": String,
    "sleep_time": String,
    "alarm": {
        "time": TimeString,
        "vibration":{
            "pattern": "double" | "rise",
            "intensity": u8,
            "duration": u16,
            "offset": u16
        },
        "heat": {
            "temp": i32,
            "offset": u16
        }
    }
}
```

`GET /settings` (Errorable) ‚Üí all settings

`GET /setting/SETTING+` (Errorable) ‚Üí specified setting
 - Example: `GET /setting/alarm/vibration/duration`

`POST /settings` (Errorable): set all settings
‚Üí
```json
{ "message": "Settings updated successfully", "settings": NewSettings }
```

`POST /setting/SETTING+` (Errorable): set specified setting
‚Üí
```json
{ "message": "Setting updated successfully", "settings": NewSettings }
```
 - Example: `POST /setting/alarm/vibration/duration -d 600`
