# Ten Sleep 🛌💤🔟

# WORK IN PROGRESS

Control the Eight Sleep Pod 3 locally and automatically!

This project uses the Pod's existing firmware (`frankenfirmware`) but replaces the DAC and disables PizzaRat (& Capybara for now).
Once setup, you __CANNOT__ use the Eight Sleep mobile app to control the bed.

## Features 😴
 1. Automatically set bed temperature every night
 2. Create a custom temperature profile
 3. Set a heat and/or vibration wakeup alarm
 4. (FUTURE) Get processed sleep tracking data from Capybara

## Setup 🥱
To use Ten Sleep you must disassemble the Eight Sleep Pod 3, modify the SD card's `rootfs.tar.gz`
to add your SSH key + root password, and reset the Pod. Then power the Pod while holding the small
button on the back, which performs a factory reset from `rootfs.tar.gz`. Now you can disable
Eight Sleep's update service and [Add Ten Sleep](#adding-ten-sleep-).
 - __Note__: the default SSH port for Pod 3 is `8822`.
 - __Disable Updates__: `systemctl disable --now swupdate-progress swupdate defibrillator eight-kernel telegraf vector`

Eventually I will add thorough tutorial for this, but for now I would recommend
[Bo Lopker's Tutorial](https://blopker.com/writing/04-zerosleep-1/#disassembly-overview)
and the [ninesleep tutorial](https://github.com/bobobo1618/ninesleep?tab=readme-ov-file#instructions).


### Adding Ten Sleep 🔟
Once this project is more complete I will create a release containing the binary.
Until then compile this repo with:

```bash
cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
```

 1. `scp` the binary, `tensleep.service`, and `settings.json` to the Pod
 2. `ssh` in, sign in as root
 3. Move the binary and json to `/opt/tensleep`
 4. Move the service file `/etc/systemd/system`
 5. Stop the DAC `systemctl stop dac`
 6. Enable the service `systemctl enable --now tensleep`
